# JavaAES Text Encryption/Decryption Tool

The JavaAES Text Encryption/Decryption Tool is a Java application that enables users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. This tool provides a simple command-line interface for users to input plaintext messages, which are then encrypted using a randomly generated AES key.Additionally, users can input the encrypted text to decrypt it back to its original plaintext form, ensuring secure communication and data confidentiality.

## Key Features: 

- Generates a random AES key for encryption.
- Encrypts plaintext messages using AES encryption algorithm.
- Decrypts encrypted text back to plaintext.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.
